# # This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

# name: CI

# # Controls when the workflow will run
# on:
#   # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
#   push:
#     branches: [ main ]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ main ]

#   # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
#   workflow_dispatch:

# # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# jobs:
#   # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
#   build:
#     # The type of runner that the job will run on
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

#     # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
#     steps:
#       # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v2

#       # Runs a single command using the runners shell
#       - name: Run a one-line script
#         run: echo Hello, world!

#       # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
#       - name: Run a multi-line script
#         run: |
#           echo Add other actions to build,
#           echo test, and deploy your project.
# name 可以自定义
name: Deploy GitHub Pages

# 触发条件：在 push 到 main/master 分支后，新的 Github 项目 应该都是 main，而之前的项目一般都是 master
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# 任务
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    # 服务器环境：最新版 Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # 拉取代码
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:

      # 生成静态文件
      - name: Build
        run: npm install && npm run docs:build

      # 部署到 GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
        with:
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }} # 也就是我们刚才生成的 secret
          BRANCH: gh-pages # 部署到 gh-pages 分支，因为 main 分支存放的一般是源码，而 gh-pages 分支则用来存放生成的静态文件
          FOLDER: docs/.vuepress/dist # vuepress 生成的静态文件存放的地方
